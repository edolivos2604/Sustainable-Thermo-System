Thermo-System Project Outline

Goal: Embedded System with IOS Mobile App Integration

Needs:
- To utilize accessible and cost efficient components to build the thermo-system using available space inside/outside a household.
- To get the thermo-system working efficiently with an outside ambient temperature that can go from -10°F to 95°F. 
- To create a mobile application will display the current status and efficiency of the thermo-system, which will also help control it.

Wants:
- To create reports on energy usage and system efficiency.
- To integrate a security camera to monitor the thermo-system form mobile app. 

Materials:
1) 2x Fans
2) 3x Temperature Sensors
3) 1x Water Pump
4) 1x Heater
5) 1x Raspberry Pi
